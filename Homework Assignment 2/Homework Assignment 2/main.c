 Create a menu of vacation destinations for the user:
 Select 1 if you would like to go to Paris.
 Select 2 if you would like to go to Rome.
 Select 3 if you would like to go to London.
 Select 4 if you would like to go to Amsterdam.
 Select 5 if you would like to go to Nairobi.
 Once they make a selection, have the user input the year they want to go.
 Using a switch statement create the following output:
 You have chosen to go to….in the year…..
 Replace the ….. With the destination they selected and year they input.
 If they make an invalid selection, let them know and exit the program.
